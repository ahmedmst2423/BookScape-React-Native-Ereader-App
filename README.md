# Getting Started with the React Native Project

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to clone, set up, and run a React Native project.

---

## Step 1: Clone the Project

To get started, clone the React Native project repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

Replace `<repository-url>` with the actual URL of the Git repository.

Navigate to the project's root directory:

```bash
cd <project-folder>
```

---

## Step 2: Install Dependencies

Install the necessary dependencies for the project:

```bash
# Using npm
npm install

# OR using Yarn
yarn install
```

This command downloads and sets up all required libraries and modules.

---

## Step 3: Set Up Environment Variables

If the project uses a `.env` file for managing environment-specific configurations:

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
2. If an example file is provided, copy it:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

3. Update the `.env` file with the correct environment-specific values.

---

## Step 4: Start the Metro Server

Metro is the JavaScript bundler that compiles and serves your React Native project. Start the Metro server with the following command:

```bash
# Using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

Let Metro Bundler run in its own terminal. Do not close this terminal while running the app.

---

## Step 5: Launch the App

Open a new terminal and run the app on your desired platform.

### For Android:

```bash
# Using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

Ensure:
- An Android emulator is running, or a physical Android device is connected with USB debugging enabled.
- Android Studio is installed and properly configured.

### For iOS:

```bash
# Using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

Ensure:
- Xcode is installed on your Mac.
- The iOS Simulator is set up, or a physical iOS device is connected.

---

## Step 6: Verify and Modify

Once the app is running:

1. Verify it works as expected.
2. To make changes, edit the `App.tsx` or any other relevant source file.
3. Use hot reloading to see changes instantly:
   - **Android**: Press <kbd>R</kbd> twice or open the Developer Menu (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>/<kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd>).
   - **iOS**: Press <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in the iOS Simulator.

---

## Step 7: Debugging and Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, follow these steps:
- Check the Metro Bundler terminal for error messages.
- Restart Metro Bundler with:

  ```bash
  npm start --reset-cache
  # OR
  yarn start --reset-cache
  ```

- Refer to the [React Native Troubleshooting Guide](https://reactnative.dev/docs/troubleshooting).

With these steps, you should be able to successfully clone, set up, and run the React Native project. ðŸŽ‰
